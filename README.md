# CarRush
With Pygame I created a game that has the main objective to avoid and pass any oncoming cars. For each car passed, the score increases by one. Gradually, as the score increases, cars will become more frequent and fast. Additionally, using NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), I allowed the user to simulate how a car would respond as generations of new cars increase and learn the game bit by bit until mastered.
